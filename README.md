# Algorithms

This is just a collection of Java code that
I have been writing to refresh my memory of
some CS basics.

I welcome any advice and critique to make
the algorithms more optimized or cleaning
up the code.

## Java
The following were Java programs that I wrote.
They are in the `src` folder.

### Knapsack
A simple algorithm to solve the famous knapsack
problem using dynamic programming.

### Sort
A collection of sorting algorithms and a base
class that contains some useful helper methods.

### Rotate
A couple of rotation algorithms to rotate an
array of integers or strings (not implemented).

## C

### Knuth
It's been a while, but I believe this was to
generate a random array of numbers. Based on one
of Knuth's famous algorithms in his programming
bibles.

### Quicksort
Self explanator, was just writing a recursive version
of Quicksort.

### Kth smallest
Gets the kth smallest number in an array.

### Hash table
A hash table implementation in C. Not decent by any
means, but was trying to understand it all.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Wikipedia and the authors for some 
of the pseudocode and visual diagrams that
helps me understand the algorithms.

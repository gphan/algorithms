Algorithms
==========

This is just a collection of Java code that
I have been writing to refresh my memory of
some CS basics.

I welcome any advice and critique to make
the algorithms more optimized or cleaning
up the code.

Knapsack
--------
A simple algorithm to solve the famous knapsack
problem using dynamic programming.

Sort
----
A collection of sorting algorithms and a base
class that contains some useful helper methods.

Rotate
------
A couple of rotation algorithms to rotate an
array of integers or strings (not implemented).

Thanks to Wikipedia and the authors for some 
of the pseudocode and visual diagrams that
helps me understand the algorithms.
